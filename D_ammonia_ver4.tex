\section{Scientific Justification}
% Nitrogen is the fifth most abundant elements in the interstellar medium (ISM) with elemental abundances of $\sim6\times10^{-5}$ with respect to hydrogen. 
\subsection{Background}
\noindent \textbf{Nitrogen chemistry} \quad Nitrogen is one of the key elements for the chemistry of star and planet formation. It is the third most abundant heavy element after carbon and oxygen \citep{Przybilla08}. Nitrogen in star-forming clouds is incorporated into planet-forming disks as volatiles such as N$_2$ or NH$_3$, which also affects disk chemistry \citep[e.g.,][]{Schwarz14} as well as compositions of planetary bodies. %These volatiles eventually become the building material of planetary bodies. 
In addition, molecules such as \ammonia that formed in molecular clouds or cloud cores set the initial condition of organic chemistry and its abundance will effectively affect the formation paths and efficiencies of nitrogen-bearing organic molecules (e.g., NH$_2$CHO and CH$_3$CN) in the later stages of star and planet formation.

To understand the nitrogen chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM), it is essential to determine the primary nitrogen reservoirs (the chemical species that predominantly hold nitrogen in the ISM). Nitrogen chemistry in the ISM consists of three competing processes; conversion from N atoms into N$_2$ molecules via gas-phase reactions, the reverse process (e.g., photodissociation), and the freeze-out of N and N$_2$ onto dust grains followed by surface reactions \citep[e.g.,][]{Daranlot12}. Thus, it is expected that the primary nitrogen reservoir is either in molecular (N$_2$) or atomic (N) form, or icy nitrogen-bearing molecules (e.g., \ammonia). However, the primary nitrogen reservoir is not fully understood. Ice observations with \textit{Spitzer} revealed that only $\sim$10\% of overall nitrogen is locked up into ices as \ammonia, NH$_4^+$, and OCN$^-$ \citep{Oberg11}. Direct observations of N and N$_2$ are challenging in both ice and gas. \citet{Maret06} instead observed N$_2$H$^+$, which is primarily formed by N$_2$ + H$_3^+$, to conclude that it is unlikely that the gaseous N$_2$ is the primary nitrogen reservoir.


% mainly due to the difficulties of direct observations of N and N$_2$ in both solid and gas phase. Several studies have attempted to observationally constrain the main nitrogen reservoir, but the results are inconclusive \citep[e.g.,][]{Oberg11, Maret06}.


% Ice observations with \textit{Spitzer} revealed that only $\sim$10\% of overall nitrogen is locked up into ices as \ammonia, NH$_4^+$, and OCN$^-$ \citep{Oberg11}. Direct observations of N and N$_2$ are difficult in both ice and gas. \citet{Maret06} instead observed N$_2$H$^+$, which is primary formed by N$_2$ + H$_3^+$, to conclude that it is unlikely that the gaseous N$_2$ is the main nitrogen reservoir. %Alternatively, a large fraction of N$_2$ might be locked up into ices. A very uncertain upper limit of N$_2$ ice abundance in molecular clouds have been inferred indirectly to be $\lesssim$40\% of overall nitrogen \citep{Boogert15}. 
%Furthermore, in situ measurements on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by the Rosetta mission suggested that a substantial amount of nitrogen is hidden as ammonium salts \citep{Altwegg20}.

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Deuteration of ammonia ice} \quad  %It is well established that deuterium enrichment is sensitive to various physical and chemical conditions and thus used to probe the formation stage of molecules \citep[e.g.,][]{Ceccarelli14}. 
\citet{Furuya18} proposed a new approach to constrain the primary nitrogen reservoir using deuteration of ammonia ice. The approach is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:ammonia_deuteration}. If \textbf{atomic nitrogen is the primary nitrogen reservoir}, ammonia ice will form primarily in dense cores because atomic nitrogen (the feedstock of ammonia ice) can still be abundant in dense cores and ice formation efficiency is higher due to their dense environment. Consequently, the D/H ratio of \ammonia (NH$_2$D/NH$_3=f_\mathrm{D1}$) is expected to be relatively high ($\sim$10$^{-2}$) due to the efficient deuteration in the dense core caused by the cold ($\lesssim20$\,K), dense ($\gtrsim10^5$\,cm$^{-3}$) environment and the freeze-out of CO. The NHD$_2$/NH$_2$D ratio ($=f_\mathrm{D2}$) will also be similarly high (but slightly lower than $f_\mathrm{D1}$ since doubly-deuterated ammonia requires two deuterium atoms), i.e., $f_\mathrm{D1} > f_\mathrm{D2}$. On the other hand, if \textbf{molecular forms (N$_2$ and NH$_3$) are the primary nitrogen reservoirs} in molecular clouds, i.e., if ammonia ice forms primarily in molecular clouds, atomic nitrogen (the feedstock of ammonia ice) is depleted in dense cores. As a result, the $f_\mathrm{D1}$ ratio is expected to be much lower ($\sim$10$^{-3}$--10$^{-4}$) because deuteration is less efficient in molecular clouds due to the relatively low density ($\sim$10$^{3}$\,cm$^{-3}$) and high UV flux. The $f_\mathrm{D2}$ ratio, on the other hand, remains higher, i.e., $f_\mathrm{D1}<f_\mathrm{D2}$, because doubly-deuterated ammonia ices form mostly in dense cores albeit with reduced formation efficiencies. A similar relation should hold between $f_\mathrm{D2}$ and ND$_3$/NHD$_2$ ($=f_\mathrm{D3}$) in each scenario.

% Similar relations for each case should be hold between $f_\mathrm{D2}$ and ND$_3$/NHD$_2$ ($=f_\mathrm{D3}$) as well.


% \citet{Furuya18} proposed a new approach to constrain the main nitrogen reservoir using multiply-deuterated ammonia ice. The approach is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:ammonia_deuteration}. If atomic nitrogen is the primary nitrogen reservoir, ammonia ice will form primarily in the dense core phase because atomic nitrogen, the ingredient of ammonia ice, can be still abundant and the ice formation efficiency is higher due to the denser environment in that phase. Therefore, the D/H ratio of NH$_3$ (NH$_2$D/NH$_3$ $=f_\mathrm{D1}$) will be relatively high ($\sim$10$^{-2}$) as deuteration is efficient due to the cold ($\lesssim$20\,K) and dense ($\gtrsim$10$^5$\,cm$^{-3}$) environment and the freeze-out of CO in dense cores. In addition, the ratios NHD$_2$/NH$_2$D ($=f_\mathrm{D2}$) will be similarly high (but slightly lower than $f_\mathrm{D1}$ because doubly-deuterated ammonia requires two deuterium atom), i.e., $f_\mathrm{D1} > f_\mathrm{D2}$. On the other hand, if the molecular species (i.e., N$_2$ and NH$_3$) are the primary nitrogen reservoir, i.e., ammonia ices are formed mainly in the molecular cloud phase, the atomic nitrogen, the ingredient of ammonia ices, will deplete in the dense core phase. Therefore, while the $f_\mathrm{D1}$ ratio will be much lower ($\sim$10$^{-4}$) as deuteration is less efficient due to the relatively low density ($\sim$10$^{3}$--10$^{4}$\,cm$^{-3}$) and higher penetration of UV flux in molecular clouds, the $f_\mathrm{D2}$ ratio will remain higher, i.e., $f_\mathrm{D1}<f_\mathrm{D2}$ since doubly-deuterated ammonia ices are mainly formed in the dense core phase, albeit with reduced formation efficiencies. A similar relation should be hold between ND$_3$/NHD$_2$ ($=f_\mathrm{D3}$) and $f_\mathrm{D2}$ as well.


% The ammonia ice, NX$_3$, where X is H or D, are mainly formed by sequential hydrogenation of \textit{atomic nitrogen} on the dust grain surfaces in molecular clouds or dense cores. 
% % In molecular clouds, their relatively high temperature ($\gtrsim$20\,K) and low density ($\sim$10$^3$--10$^4$\,cm$^{-3}$) will result in a lower D/H ratio ($\sim$10$^{-3}$--10$^{-4}$), while it will be higher in dense cores (or prestellar cores) due to their cold ($\lesssim$20\,K) and dense ($\gtrsim$10$^5$\,cm$^{-3}$) environment and the freeze-out of CO.
% In molecular clouds, where density is $\sim$10$^3$--10$^4$\,cm$^{-3}$, the molecular D/H ratios are lower ($\sim$10$^{-3}$--10$^{-4}$), while it will be higher in dense cores (or prestellar cores) due to their cold ($\lesssim$20\,K) and dense ($\gtrsim$10$^5$\,cm$^{-3}$) environment and the freeze-out of CO.
% %In particular, the abundance ratios such as NHD$_2$/NH$_2$D ($=f_\mathrm{D2}$) and ND$_3$/NHD$_2$ ($=f_\mathrm{D3}$) selectively reflect the deuteration in dense cores over the NH$_2$D/NH$_3$ ($=f_\mathrm{D1}$) because multiply-deuterated ammonia ices are mostly formed in the dense core stage where the deuteration is particularly efficient. Thus, if the atomic nitrogen (ingredient of ammonia ice) is the main nitrogen reservoir and ammonia ices are mainly formed in dense cores, $f_\mathrm{D2}$ and $f_\mathrm{D3}$ will be lower than $f_\mathrm{D1}$ and $f_\mathrm{D2}$, respectively (the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:ammonia_deuteration}). On the other hand, if the atomic nitrogen is largely converted into the stable molecular form (i.e., N$_2$ and NH$_3$) in molecular clouds and the formation of ammonia ices continues with a reduced efficiency in dense cores, $f_\mathrm{D2}$ and $f_\mathrm{D3}$ should be comparable to or larger than $f_\mathrm{D1}$ and $f_\mathrm{D2}$, respectively (the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:ammonia_deuteration}).  
% The abundance ratios of NHD$_2$/NH$_2$D ($=f_\mathrm{D2}$) selectively reflect the deuteration in dense cores over the NH$_2$D/NH$_3$ ($=f_\mathrm{D1}$) because doubly-deuterated ammonia ices are mostly formed in the dense core stage where the deuteration is particularly efficient. 
% Thus, if the atomic nitrogen is largely converted into the stable molecular form (i.e., N$_2$ and NH$_3$) in molecular clouds and the formation of ammonia ices continues with a reduced efficiency in dense cores, $f_\mathrm{D2}$ should be larger than $f_\mathrm{D1}$ (the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:ammonia_deuteration}). On the other hand, if the atomic nitrogen (ingredient of ammonia ice) is the main nitrogen reservoir and ammonia ices are mainly formed in dense cores, $f_\mathrm{D2}/f_\mathrm{D1}$ will be close to the statistical value (1/3) and $f_\mathrm{D2}$ will be lower than $f_\mathrm{D1}$ (the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:ammonia_deuteration}).
% Thus, if the atomic nitrogen (ingredient of ammonia ice) is the main nitrogen reservoir and ammonia ices are mainly formed in dense cores, $f_\mathrm{D2}/f_\mathrm{D1}$ will be close to the statistical value (1/3) and $f_\mathrm{D2}$ will be lower than $f_\mathrm{D1}$ (the right panel of Figure \ref{fig:ammonia_deuteration}). On the other hand, if the atomic nitrogen is largely converted into the stable molecular form (i.e., N$_2$ and NH$_3$) in molecular clouds and the formation of ammonia ices continues with a reduced efficiency in dense cores, $f_\mathrm{D2}$ should be comparable to or larger than $f_\mathrm{D1}$ (the left panel of Figure \ref{fig:ammonia_deuteration}). 
\citet{Furuya18} quantitatively confirmed these scenarios by conducting the gas-ice astrochemical simulation from the formation of molecular clouds to the protostellar core stage with different initial nitrogen partitions (Table \ref{tab:model}). Indeed, the two models present a striking contrast: while the atom dominant model shows $f_\mathrm{D1} > f_\mathrm{D2} > f_\mathrm{D3}$, for the molecule dominant model $f_\mathrm{D1} \ll f_\mathrm{D2} \approx f_\mathrm{D3}$ is satisfied.

Currently, the best and only way to measure the D/H ratios of interstellar ammonia ices is to observe the fresh ammonia gas that has just sublimated from the dust grain surfaces in the inner warm (typically $\lesssim$100\,au and $T\gtrsim100$\,K) region of the protostellar envelopes, so-called \textit{hot corinos}. \textbf{Here, we propose to observe NH$_2$D, NHD$_2$, and ND$_3$ molecular lines at $\sim$300\,GHz to measure the D/H ratios of ammonia ice toward multiple hot corinos, taking advantage of the unique combination of high resolution and high sensitivity of ALMA. This will reveal the primary nitrogen reservoir in star-forming clouds and will be the crucial first step to elucidating nitrogen chemistry in the ISM.}

\subsection{Previous observations of ammonia deuteration}
% Surprisingly, recent observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) found an extremely high D/H ratio of $f_\mathrm{D1}\sim0.5$--1 toward the hot corinos of the protobinary NGC1333 IRAS4A (Figure \ref{fig:IRAS4A_VLA}, article in preparation). 

% This is even higher than the value in the atom dominant model \cite[0.02;][]{Furuya18} by orders of magnitude.     

% So far, observations of the deuteration for several abundant molecules toward hot corinos have been reported. The D/H ratios of water (HDO/H$_2$O) have been revealed to be relatively low \citep[$\sim$10$^{-3}$--10$^{-4}$; e.g.,][]{Jorgensen10}, while those of methanol (CH$_3$OD/CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH/CH$_3$OH) are higher \citep[$\sim$10$^{-2}$; e.g.,][]{Bianchi17}. This contrast suggests that water ices are formed mainly in molecular clouds, followed by the formation of methanol ices in the later evolutionary stage (i.e., molecular cloud core). The astrochemical model presented in \citet{Furuya18} have also supported this picture.

Recent observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) have detected the multiple \ammonia and NH$_2$D lines toward the hot corinos of NGC1333~IRAS4A2 (Figure \ref{fig:IRAS4A_VLA}, article in preparation), and the $f_\mathrm{D1}$ abundance ratio has been constrained for the first time in hot corinos. Surprisingly, the ratio is extremely high ($\sim$0.5--1) and even higher than the value in the atom dominant model (Table \ref{tab:model}). This possibly suggests that ammonia ices are formed in the later evolutionary stage and that the atomic nitrogen remains as the primary nitrogen reservoir in that stage. On the other hand, there are still possibilities that the NH$_2$D line emission traces a more extended region than the NH$_3$ line within the observed beam ($\sim$1\farcs3 or $\sim$390\,au), as indicated by the narrower line width and lower excitation energy of the NH$_2$D line (see the spectra in Figure \ref{fig:IRAS4A_VLA}). This might be the cause of the extremely high $f_\mathrm{D1}$ ratio as the D/H ratios are expected to be higher in the outer region \citep{Furuya18}. Observations with higher angular resolutions are needed to selectively trace the innermost region where ammonia ices have fully sublimated. Also, these observations are just the first attempt to constrain ammonia deuteration and the primary nitrogen reservoir. Further observations of deuterated ammonia lines toward another source are required to confirm that the high D/H ratios of ammonia are common. 



%The high excitation energies of the lines observed ($\gtrsim$100\,K) and small emitting region size ($\sim$100\,au) derived from the line profile fit indicate that the observed line emission originates from the inner warm region where the ammonia ices have fleshly sublimated. Thus, 
% The high $f_\mathrm{D1}$ ratio possibly suggests that the ammonia ices are mainly formed in the dense core stage and the atomic nitrogen still remains as the main nitrogen reservoir in that stage. However, these observations did not constrain $f_\mathrm{D2}$ or $f_\mathrm{D3}$, which are essential for robustly claiming the main nitrogen reservoir, and are just the first attempt to constrain the main nitrogen reservoir.


%\citet{Jorgensen10} have found a low HDO/H$_2$O abundance ratio of $\lesssim6 \times 10^{-4}$ for the first time toward the hot corino in NGC1333 IRAS4B. 
% \citet{Coutens14} have observed the doubly-deuterated water (D$_2$O) toward another hot corino in NGC1333 IRAS2A to find a higher D$_2$O/HDO ratio than HDO/H$_2$O ratio by about one order of magnitude. This has been interpreted as follows: the formation of water ices started in molecular clouds, which resulted in the low HDO/H$_2$O ratio, and continued with a reduced efficiency in dense cores as reflected in the relatively high D$_2$O/HDO ratio \citep{Furuya16}. This work demonstrated that the multiply-deuterated specie can be a powerful tool to trace the formation history of molecules.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) have detected the multiple \ammonia and NH$_2$D lines toward the hot corinos of the protobinary NGC1333~IRAS4A (Figure \ref{fig:IRAS4A_VLA}, private communication). The $f_\mathrm{D1}$ column density ratio has been constrained for the first time in hot corinos to be $\sim$0.5--1 by employing the line profile fit. %The high excitation energies of the lines observed ($\gtrsim$100\,K) and small emitting region size ($\sim$100\,au) derived from the line profile fit indicate that the observed line emission originates from the inner warm region where the ammonia ices have fleshly sublimated.

\noindent \textbf{Target sources and lines} \quad NGC1333 IRAS4A2 (hereafter IRAS4A2) and IRAS 16293-2422 A (hereafter I16293A) are well-studied sources in the Perseus star-forming complex \citep[$\sim$300\,pc;][]{Zucker18} and the $\rho$ Ophiucus star-forming region \citep[$\sim$140\,pc;][]{Dzib18}, respectively. Both sources are hot corinos as indicated by the emission of various complex organic molecules (COMs).
% Both sources present the emission of various complex organic molecules (COMs), whose sublimation temperatures ($\sim$100\,K) are similar to ammonia and water, in their hot corinos. 
% The abundances of COMs as well as their isotopic ratios have been inferred \citep[e.g.,][]{Lopez-Sepulcre17, Manigand20}. 
Among the known hot corinos, these sources show the highest column densities of abundant volatiles (e.g., $N$(H$_2$O)$\,\sim\,$10$^{19}$--10$^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$), which makes these sources most promising to detect weak deuterated ammonia lines assuming the standard abundance ratio in the ISM (e.g., NH$_3$/H$_2$O$\sim$0.05) and probe the inner warm region where ammonia ices have fully sublimated ($\sim$0\farcs5) with a sufficient angular resolution within a reasonable integration time. In addition, these sources are not so severe in dust absorption, which ensures the detection of weak lines (see also Section \ref{sec:desc_obs}).

% For IRAS4A2, %it is difficult to detect the ND$_3$ line with a sufficient angular resolution due to the larger distance; instead, the ancillary data from previous VLA observations of NH$_3$ and NH$_2$D lines helps constrain the main nitrogen reservoir. 
These sources are therefore the ideal targets for constraining the primary nitrogen reservoir.

The ALMA Band 7 provides a unique opportunity to observe the multiply-deuterated ammonia lines at $\sim$300\,GHz. While VLA covers the frequencies of main isotopologue NH$_3$ transitions as well as deuterated isotopologues, the sensitivity is not enough to detect deuterated isotopologues at high angular resolutions ($\sim$0\farcs5). Whereas ALMA does not cover the frequencies of detectable NH$_3$ lines, the high sensitivity enables us to detect weak deuterated ammonia lines with a high angular resolution, and constrain $f_\mathrm{D2}$ and $f_\mathrm{D3}$ abundance ratios at once to distinguish two scenarios. In particular, the ND$_3$ lines, which are essential to constrain the $f_\mathrm{D3}$ ratio, are detectable only at $\sim$300\,GHz within reasonable integration time. 

% While the most abundant isotopologue, \ammonia (and $^{15}$NH$_3$ as well), are not observable with ALMA and VLA can observe it, the NHD$_2$ and ND$_3$ lines are detectable only with ALMA at high angular resolution \citep{Furuya18}.    


% \medskip
% \noindent \textbf{Target sources} \quad We propose to observe two sources, IRAS~16293-2422 and NGC1333~IRAS4A, located at the $\rho$ Ophiucus star-forming region \citep[$\sim$140\,pc;][]{Dzib18} and the Perseus star-forming complex \citep[$\sim$300\,pc;][]{Zucker18}, respectively. Both sources are deeply embedded Class~0 protobinaries, and each of the binaries harbors a hot corino. Previous observations and the justification of these sources are described below.

% \begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
%     \setlength\itemsep{-0.2em}
    
%     \item IRAS~16293-2422 -- This source has been extensively studied mainly by the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey \citep[PILS;][]{Jorgensen16}. Both sources of the binary (IRAS~16293~A and IRAS~16293~B) show the various complex organic molecule (COM) emission in the vicinity of the protostar. The isotopic ratios have been inferred for various molecules \citep{Jorgensen18, Manigand20}, which have been compared with the isotopic composition in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko \citep{Drozdovskaya19}. Among the well known hot corinos, IRAS~16293-2422 is the nearest source and shows the highest column densities of abundant volatiles (H$_2$O and CH$_3$OH), which will uniquely and simultaneously allows for resolving the inner warm region ($\lesssim$100\,au or $\sim$0\farcs7) and detecting the weak ND$_3$ line, assuming the standard ISM abundance ratios. Thus, IRAS~16293-2422 is the best and ideal testbed for constraining the main nitrogen reservoir.  
    
%     % While IRAS~16293~B presents the face-on configuration, IRAS~16293~A shows the more inclined structure. Recent higher spatial resolution observations of dust continuum emission with ALMA revealed that IRAS~16293~A itself can be a binary and has a complicated continuum structure.  
    
%     \item NGC1333~IRAS4A -- This source is also a well-studied protobinary, both of which show the COM line emission as revealed by centimeter observations with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array \citep[VLA;][]{DeSimone20}. Toward the both of the binary (IRAS~4A1 and IRAS~4A2), recent VLA observations of NH$_3$ and NH$_2$D lines revealed high NH$_2$D/NH$_3$ ratios of $\sim$0.5--1 (private communication), which suggests that the main nitrogen reservoir is atomic nitrogen rather than N-bearing molecules. However, confirmation by doubly- and triply-deuterated ammonia that better trace the main nitrogen reservoir is needed. Combining with the ancillary VLA data, this source will allow us to constrain the main nitrogen reservoir in the secondary source.
% \end{itemize}

\smallskip
\noindent \textbf{Analysis method and impact} \quad We request to observe \emph{multiple, optically thin} NH$_2$D, NHD$_2$, and ND$_3$ lines with different excitation energy levels. This enables us to constrain the column densities of NH$_2$D, NHD$_2$, and ND$_3$ (and the ratios of $f_\mathrm{D2}$ and $f_\mathrm{D3}$) without the temperature assumption. In the case that all lines originate from the same region (e.g., similar line widths and emitting region sizes), we will employ the standard LTE/non-LTE analysis with a single excitation/kinetic temperature for all transitions (i.e., rotation diagram method for LTE/LVG analysis for non-LTE). If it is not the case or the line profile is complicated (e.g., asymmetric features due to the infall motion of the gas), we will employ detailed radiative transfer simulations of the hot corinos, which will be compared with the observed line profile to constrain the column densities (and $f_\mathrm{D2}$ and $f_\mathrm{D3}$ ratios). As the physical structures for the simulation, we can use the well-established models of IRAS4A2 and I16293A in literature \citep[e.g.,][]{Persson16, Jacobsen18}. %Note that the ND$_3$ 1(0)0,a--0(0)0,s transition at 309.90\,GHz has the hyperfine splitting that could be spectrally resolved, which can be treated by the spectral line fitting by LTE/non-LTE models and could help determine the ND$_3$ abundance with only this transition.

The estimated column density ratios will be compared with the predictions of the model presented in \citet{Furuya18} (Table \ref{tab:model}). As discussed above, the relation between $f_\mathrm{D2}=$ NHD$_2$/NH$_2$D and $f_\mathrm{D3}=$ ND$_3$/NHD$_2$ reflects the primary nitrogen reservoir (Table \ref{tab:obs_resevoir}). If the observed column density ratios satisfy $f_\mathrm{D2} \lesssim f_\mathrm{D3}$, the primary nitrogen reservoir would be molecular forms (i.e., molecule dominant) and ammonia ices are formed mainly in molecular clouds. On the other hand, if the observed column density ratios satisfy $f_\mathrm{D2} > f_\mathrm{D3}$, the primary nitrogen reservoir would be atomic nitrogen (i.e., atom dominant) and ammonia ices are mainly formed in dense cores. If these two ratios are similar, it may indicate that ammonia ices are formed at intermediate evolutionary stages and both atomic nitrogen and molecular forms (N$_2$ or NH$_3$) would make up a significant portion of the nitrogen reservoir. In any case, the proposed observations will provide important implications for the nitrogen reservoir in the ISM. These implications have a significant impact on nitrogen chemistry. We will use the results to \textbf{benchmark the nitrogen chemistry in astrochemical models} and \textbf{interpret how nitrogen will be incorporated into planet-forming disks and eventually planetary bodies}. Proposed observations will also be the basis of the future observations of deuterated ammonia molecules.

% \smallskip
% \noindent \textbf{Comparison with models} \quad The estimated column density ratios will be compared with the predictions of the model presented in \citet{Furuya18} (Table \ref{tab:model}). 
% % They conducted the gas-ice astrochemical simulation from the formation of molecular clouds to the protostellar core stage with different initial nitrogen partitions (Table \ref{tab:model}). The two models present a striking contrast: while the molecule dominant model shows $f_\mathrm{D1} \ll f_\mathrm{D2} \approx f_\mathrm{D3}$, $f_\mathrm{D1} > f_\mathrm{D2} > f_\mathrm{D3}$ for the atom dominant model, quantitatively evidencing that ammonia deuteration can trace the main nitrogen reservoir. 
% If the observed column density ratios satisfy $f_\mathrm{D2} < f_\mathrm{D3}$, the main nitrogen reservoir would be molecular form and the formation of ammonia ices started in molecular clouds and continues with a reduced efficiency in dense cores. On the other hand, if the observed column density ratios satisfy $f_\mathrm{D2} > f_\mathrm{D3}$, the main nitrogen reservoir would be atomic nitrogen and ammonia ices are mainly formed in dense cores.

% Introduction: Importance of nitrogen chemistry, and it is not yet elucidated, deuteration of ammonia ice can trace the ice formation history and nitrogen partitioning...

% Furuya+18 proposed that the ice formation history and information about main nitrogen reservoir are imprinted into the multiply deuterated ammonia ices. [NHD2/NH2D]/[NH2D/NH3] reflects the deuteration levels of different evolutionary stages. Non-statistical ratio of [D2O/HDO]/[HDO/H2O] is explained by the scenario that the H2O ices are formed in the ealier stages mainly and the formation efficiency is reduced in the later dense core stage

% We can measure the ice deuteration by observing the hot gas sublimated from dust grain surface in the vicinity of the protostar (hot corino)

% We already constrained the NH2D/NH3 ratio with VLA toward prototypical hot corino IRAS 4A. High ratio suggests NH3 ice formed in the later dense core and main nitrogen reservoir could be mostly atomic N toward IRAS 4A. 

% However, we need multiply deuterated ammonia to confirm the scenario proposed in Yamato et al. i.e., how is the ND3/NHD2 ratio which will better trace the later stage ice formation? Also, we need additional sources to confirm if this scenario is ubiquitous or not.

\section{Description of Observations}\label{sec:desc_obs}

\noindent \textbf{Angular resolution and sensitivity} \quad We request spatial resolutions of 0\farcs5 (or $\sim$150\,au and $\sim$70\,au) for IRAS4A2 and I16293A, respectively. The resolutions are matched to the size of inner warm regions where ammonia ices have sublimated based on the previous VLA NH$_3$ observations \citep[][, article in preparation]{Choi10} and ALMA COM line observations \citep{Manigand20}. We note that we do not seek to spatially resolve the ammonia sublimation regions. Although recent observations suggest complicated continuum structures at the smaller spatial scales in I16293A, possibly indicative of a binary \citep{Maureira20}, we can constrain the beam-averaged column density ratios, which will be used to infer the nitrogen reservoir.

The targeted lines and their expected intensities are summarized in Table \ref{tab:lines}. To evaluate the expected intensities, we used the estimates of column densities and temperatures from previous observations and the D/H ratios from the conservative model predictions in Table \ref{tab:model} and calculated the synthetic LTE spectra. See the technical justification for details. 
% For IRAS4A2, we assume $N(\mathrm{NH_2D})=4.9\times10^{17}$\,cm$^{-2}$, $T_\mathrm{ex}=160$\,K, and a source size of 0\farcs3 from the VLA observations (Figure \ref{fig:IRAS4A_VLA}), and the conservative D/H ratios from the atom dominant model. For I16293 A, we assume $N(\mathrm{H_2O}) = 5.3\times10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$ with the standard ISM abundance ratio of NH$_3$/H$_2$O $\sim$ 0.05 (i.e., $N(\mathrm{NH_3}) = 2.7\times10^{19}$\,cm$^{-2}$), $T_\mathrm{ex}=130$\,K, and a source size of 0\farcs5 from previous ALMA observations \citep{Persson13, Manigand20}, and the conservative D/H ratios from the molecular dominant model. 
All target lines are found to be optically thin. Based on these estimates, we request 1.0 mJy beam$^{-1}$ per 1.0 km\,s$^{-1}$ and 0.83\,km\,s$^{-1}$ velocity channel widths for IRAS4A2 and I16293A, respectively, to detect the weakest ND$_3$ lines at $\gtrsim$3$\sigma$. 
% We note that we do not request to detect ND$_3$ lines toward IRAS4A2: instead, we will additionally use the previous VLA observations to distinguish the two scenario by $f_\mathrm{D1}$ and $f_\mathrm{D2}$. 
We note that even if the ND$_3$ lines are not detected, we can distinguish the two scenarios by constraining the upper limit on the $f_\mathrm{D3}$ ratio. We also note that we carefully checked that the spectral contaminations by other lines, which strongly complicates the column density estimation, are not expected for target transitions.

% no spectral contamination by other lines, which strongly complicates the column density estimation, is expected for target transitions.

\noindent \textbf{Continuum optical depth issue} \quad It is important, in particular for (sub-)millimeter observations, to consider the absorption by optically thick continuum emission from the dusty envelope, which could hide the molecular line emission. We carefully take this effect into account: for IRAS4A2, we corrected the absorption factor \citep[$e^{-\tau_\mathrm{c}}$ where $\tau_\mathrm{c}\sim0.6$ is the dust optical depth at $\sim$300\,GHz;][ with assuming an opacity slope of $\beta=1$]{DeSimone20} in estimated intensities and the corrected ones are presented in Table \ref{tab:lines}. I16293A is known to be less severe in dust continuum absorption, although the estimates on optical depths have not been made. We will use the spectra at the offset position from the continuum peak as in \citet{Manigand20} if the continuum absorption appeared in the innermost region.



% \quad Recent observations in (sub-)millimeter have revealed that the optically thick dust continuum emission from the protostellar dusty envelope can absorb the molecular line emission, which complicates the estimates of column density. \citet{DeSimone20} estimated the dust continuum optical depth at millimeter wavelength in NGC1333~IRAS4A by comparing the centimeter observations with VLA and millimeter observations with ALMA, which revealed that the line emission in millimeter wavelength is significantly reduced by dust absorption. Thus, we consider the dust absorption factor ($e^{-\tau_\mathrm{c}}$, where $\tau_\mathrm{c}$ is the continuum optical depth at $\sim$300\,GHz) for the calculation of requested sensitivity toward IRAS~4A2 (see Section \ref{sec:desc_obs}). For IRAS~16293-2422, we will use the spectra extracted from the offset position ($\sim$one or half beam size) from the continuum peak to avoid the dust absorption as well as the complicated line profile due to the infall motion of the gas as demonstrated in \citet{Jorgensen16}. We emphasize that we do not aim at detecting the lines toward IRAS~4A1, where the dust absorption is the most severe. 

% Please describe the observations to be made and their specific
% purpose, with a clear explanation of the need for, and 
% appropriateness of, ALMA Cycle 9 data.
